                Spinal Decompression has become the most advanced non-surgical tool aimed at treating arm, leg, neck and back pain associated with disc herniations and degeneration.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In January 2002, Dr. Caruso was among the first chiropractors to introduce this breakthrough technology to Westchester County. Since then, Dr. Caruso’s Scarsdale, NY based facility, Spine Care, has established a unique precedent with the success of pre and post MRI scans. His impressive results have now inspired a large network of referring physicians and chiropractors (throughout Westchester County and Manhattan) who work closely with Dr. Caruso.
